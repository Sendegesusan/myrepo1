I now try to learn using github from RStudio

## My first code on Git
in academic research,researchers working with causal inference would wish to assign students/units randomly to organisations to examine the effect of internship training on absorption into the job world. In cases when the study is to be done following conventional RCT, assigning the students to organisation and/or randomly giving organisations students can be daunting activity to many.

This R  code has been prepared to put this off the researcher's shoulders. It enable researchers in academic institutions to assign students to institutions for internship placements

Assume there are two tables (data frames) in the data base, the student table organisation table. 
 - assume the student tables among others provide information on the student's qualification and the organisation table provide information on the skills needed in-terms degree program
 
Prior to using the code, one has to make a few data cleaning to enable meaningful results, these include:

- Making sure that the spelling are the same for both student program of study and the degree program specified by the organisation

- Identify these variables from the two data frame and provide as arguments to the R function

- The organisation specifies the number of slots available, Identify this variable and supply it to R function

- Make sure that the names of these variables are the same as those supplied to the function



Nice journey as you perform the random assignment
